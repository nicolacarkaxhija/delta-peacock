# Changelog

## 0.1.1 (2026-09-23)

### Tests

- Branch coverage gate restored: 95.56% of branches against the 95% gate, up from 93.99%.

## 0.1.0 (2026-09-23)

First npm release.

### Features

- `delta-peacock` CLI: `review`, `audit`, `describe`, `ask`, `fix`, `waive`, `learn`, `stats`, `guidelines`, `doctor`, `init`, `bench`, `config`.
- Guideline-anchored findings: each finding cites a markdown guideline and inherits its severity; the gate is a deterministic exit code (`0` pass, `1` tool error, `2` gate failure).
- Guidelines read from the merge target so a pull request cannot weaken them.
- SCM adapters for GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket Cloud plus local mode, with idempotent fingerprinted comments and Bitbucket Code Insights.
- Model providers: Anthropic, Amazon Bedrock, OpenRouter and any OpenAI-compatible host, with multi-model ensemble review.
- Reports as JSON, SARIF 2.1.0 and GitLab Code Quality.
- Cost guard with per-review and monthly caps, secret and PII redaction, response cache, `--dry-run` guarantee.
- Curated starter packs (`security`, `typescript`) and the config JSON Schema ship in the package.

### Requirements

- Node.js 22.12 or newer.
